Dog-walk thought: how cool would it be if the Nintendo Switch would support publishing screenshots through <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub" rel="ugc">https://indieweb.org/Micropub</a> ? Instead, I&#39;m left to fiddling with Birdsite to manually <a href="https://indieweb.org/PESOS" rel="ugc">https://indieweb.org/PESOS</a> these things, after which I can finally use them in <a href="http://jefklakscodex.com/" rel="ugc">jefklakscodex.com/</a> ... As long as big companies only support silo infrastructures, we&#39;re left with PESOS instead of POSSE.
