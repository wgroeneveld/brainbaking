Many sites seem to use it, but it of course only scans your own Twitter/Masto feed. IMO, this renders it a bit useless unless you&#39;re very popular (ðŸ˜°). Anyone you don&#39;t know could talk about a post on your site, but it won&#39;t be received since these systems do not push webmentions themselves. Furthermore, I do not see anyone manually posting a link at the end of a post - that kind of defeats the purpose. <br>That said, is it working for you?
