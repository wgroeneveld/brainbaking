Trying to wrap my mind around WebMentions and how I could implement them without resorting to a third-party provider... <a href="https://sebastiandedeyne.com/adding-webmentions-to-my-blog/" rel="ugc">https://sebastiandedeyne.com/adding-webmentions-to-my-blog/</a> I wonder if a link such as this one would receive a webmention/pingback if I just write about it using Hugo.
