<p>Hi <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url mention" data-user="A4fIvtjUepzOyQooXg" href="https://mastodon.laurakalbag.com/@laura" rel="ugc">@<span>laura</span></a></span> thanks to your <a href="https://laurakalbag.com/what-is-mastodon-and-why-should-i-use-it">https://laurakalbag.com/what-is-mastodon-and-why-should-i-use-it</a>/ I dipped my toes into decentralized social networks 😅 FYI The “What’s wrong with Twitter” link on there is broken. Loving what you do so far, you made me reconsider accessibility and privacy features on my own site!</p>
