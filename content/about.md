## ... Baker

* I hold a [professional bread baker's degree](/post/learning-to-become-a-baker/) so naturally I love to think of myself as a real baker. I highly respect the craft and enjoy kneading dough with my hands.
* I specialize in _sourdough bread_, as you can read at my [bread baking blog](https://redzuurdesem.be). I love to rekindle the interest in sourdough by organizing workshops. 
* I've written a book on [the science of sourdough bread](https://redzuurdesem.be/het-boek).

## ... Researcher

* I am a PhD researcher at the [Faculty of Engineering Technology](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/english), KU Leuven. 
* My [academic research](/research) focuses on identifying and amplifying non-technical skills in software engineering education, primarily targetting _creative problem solving_.
* I mainly employ qualitative methods and prefer to mix disciplines such as computing education, cognitive psychology, and architecture.

## ... Programmer

- I'm an experienced software engineer and took on various roles from agile coaching to technical lead. I hold a Master of Computer Science from [Hasselt Univeristy](https://www.uhasselt.be/edm). Take a look at my [<svg class='icon'><use xlink:href='#github'></use></svg>Github account](https://github.com/wgroeneveld).
- I’m a heavy Test Driven Development fan and I bark at those who don’t. I taught agile software engineering techniques in both industry and academia.
- I dislike specializing in one particular programming language: the more there is to learn, the better, although I prefer dynamic languages. 


## ... Writer

* I'm a [fountain pen addict](/post/fountain-pens-first-look/) and avid [<svg class='icon icon-text'><use xlink:href='#book'></use></svg>journaler](/post/journaling-in-practice/). I love jotting down stuff.
* [This blog](/post) is the ideal place to write down my _freshly baked thoughts_ about virtually anything, primarily intended to amuse myself, and hopefully also others.
* Oh, and as said, I've published a book on [the science of sourdough bread](https://redzuurdesem.be/het-boek) and occasionally take part in [National Novel Writing Months](https://nanowrimo.org) - withing varying results.

## ... Teacher

* Transforming knowledge into well-digestible material is my mission. As they say: _the best way to learn something is to teach it_ - I couldn't agree more.
* Besides various formal [teaching assignments](/teaching/) at KU Leuven, I've also coached software developers in different companies, and occasionally organize bread baking workshops.
* I also like public speaking.

If you found my work amusing and/or helpful, you can [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/woutergroeneveld) - if you don't mind I'll use it to drink a cup of tea instead. I also like to hear your feedback via (encrypted) e-mail: <a class="meel">say hello</a>. Thanks!

## What's a _multiclass_?

[Multiclassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Multiclassing) in Dungeons & Dragons (yes, I'm also a nerd) allows your character to advance in more than one class. Instead of playing as the conventional mage or fighter, you can be both. This concept neatly summarizes my vision of a profession.

There are multiple concepts all defining the same thing:

- Emilie Wapnick uses the term [multipotentialite](https://puttylike.com/terminology/). A multipotentialite is _someone with many interests and creative pursuits_.
- Philosopher Johann von Wowern wrote in 1603 about [_polymaths_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath): _knowledge of various matters, drawn from all kinds of studies [...] ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines, as far as the human mind, with unwearied industry, is able to pursue them_.
- Another lovely term is _renaissance men_: _a person with many talents or areas of knowledge_. Da Vinci is the prime example of such a man. Of course I couldn't possibly live up to these expectations. The notion of a [homo universalis](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uomo_universale) might also be stretching it a bit too far. 


I used to be only good at programming because I thought, as a Computer Scientist, you specialize instead of generalize. But the more I worked with computers, the more my hands itched to do something else. So nowadays I love to go wide and pass on that enthusiasm for knowledge on any level.

## Where good ideas come from: books

I keep an active <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5451893-wouter" target="_blank"><svg class='icon'><use xlink:href='#goodreads'></use></svg>Goodreads</a> account where I manage everything I've read and want to read. I invite you to join the community there. Marking a book as read and writing a (short) review never was that satisfying... 

I used to be almost exclusively a fantasy reader. Now I mostly read non-fiction on the most diverse topics, but I do have a soft spot for things like philosophy, art, mindful food and software engineering. 

These are the latest 12 books I've read:
