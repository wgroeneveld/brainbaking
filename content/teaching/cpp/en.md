## _Course notes_

This is the English index page, roughly based on the [Dutch index](/teaching/cpp/), where students can find more information regarding the course itself. All links below contain content in Dutch. 

### Project results 2018 - 2019

<br/>

Utilizing the custom-built [gba-sprite-engine](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine/) library residing at <i class='fa fa-github'></i>  Github. See the README there for more information. The engine itself uses the [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm) C calls behind the scenes. 

#### Survey results

24 recorded participants. 

> [1] Have you ever played a Game Boy (Advance) game before?
