## Academic Research

My academic research focuses on identifying and amplifying non-technical skills in software engineering education, primarily focusing on _creative problem solving_ skills. I also [blog about the subject](/categories/education/). 

Below is an overview of every **accepted** paper that is related to this research. Most publications are in ACM [SIGCSE-related](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/) conferences/journals because Computing Education is my field of research.

I am affiliated with KU Leuven's [Faculty of Engineering Technology](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/english) in Diepenbeek, Belgium. Find out more about me in [the about page](/about).

> Engaging Software Engineering Students in Grading:<br/> The effects of peer assessment on self-evaluation, motivation, and study time <span>2020, published in Proceedings of the 48th SEFI Conference 2020 (to appear)</span>

We explored **self-evaluation, motivation, and study time of students in relation to peer assessment (RQ)**, as part of an ongoing project at our local faculty (again involving the Game Boy Advance - any excuse is good, right?). 

Students seem to get much better at evaluating their own project on some, but not all, of the evaluation criteria after a peer assessment session, and students report in a follow-up survey that they are more motivated to work on their project.

Co-authored with [Brett Becker](http://www.brettbecker.com/). Brett and I curated and analyzed a database of Computing syllabi full of **non-technical courses to look for patterns in learning outcomes (RQ)**. 

110 universities in Europe and 278 courses revealed skills categorized in _project, humanities, business, communication, coaching, professional, seminar_, and _creativity_. Again, the last group proved to only contain `1.4%` of all courses!

Our first exiting results of student motivation and creative problem solving using the GBA sprite engine (see below) were summarized in this poster. We used Amabile's Creativity Model (_motivation_, _creative skills_, _expertise_) and did expert assessments.

But most of all, we just wanted to show off what kinds of games our students made during the first year. There's a video available in the poster page. Data and details: [see SIGCSE 2020 poster](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328778.3372606).

Co-authored with Hans Jacobs from [Prato](https://www.prato.be/). We asked software engineering experts all over the world: "**what do you think is a critical non-technical skill to excel as a developer? (RQ)**" The result is a long list of skills such as _systematically verify assumptions and validate results_ and _be creative by approaching a problem from different angles_. 

It's interesting to see that all three panel groups (technical experts, business experts, and academics) picked something else as the top skills. _Problem solving_ is mentioned most often, perhaps unsurprisingly.

> Software Engineering Education beyond the Technical:<br/> A Systematic Literature Review <span>2019, published in [Proceedings of the 47th SEFI Conference 2019](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/retrieve/549742): vol. 47, (1607-1622)</span>

A first step towards identifying **which non-technical skills are currently being taught in the field of software engineering education (RQ)**. During our literature analysis, we discovered that _self-reflection, conflict resolution, communication_ and _teamwork_ are the top four taught skills while skills such as _creativity_ and _empathy_ dangle at the bottom. 

_Internships_ and _capstone projects_ seem to be underrepresented as teaching aspects to facilitate the learning of these skills. It's also staggering to see so little papers mention _creativity_, especially in project development.

## Curiosity-based Research

Besides my academic obligations, I love to find out how things work on anything that peaks my interest, ranging from technical computer-related subjects to bread baking, drawing, art, and philosophy. I call this research "_curiosity-based_", and while the results might not be published in academic journals, they are still significant to me, and hopefully also to others.

>  Save Sourdough: <br/>A Personal Quest For the Taste and Science of Bread <span>Self-published and available at [redzuurdesem.be](https://redzuurdesem.be/het-boek)</span>

"Red Zuurdesem" (Save Sourdough) is a book I wrote in Dutch about sourdough bread, bundling 10 years of personal knowledge into 370 pages. 

The book has been "baked" with love in which slowly fermented ideas from both practical and theoretical worlds merge with success into one deliciously smelling whole, generously sprinkled with tips and formulas to get started with baking yourself.

Read more and buy it at the Dutch website [Red Zuurdesem](https://redzuurdesem.be/het-boek).

A bitmap-based GBA 3D software engine written in C++. It's framework is based on the older sprite-based engine, adding 3D matrices/vertices math to convert 3D coordinates to a 2D pane. 

The GBA is obviously not made to do these kinds of things. I wanted to toy around with fixed-point math and learn about vertex shaders along the way.

A sprite-based GBA engine written in C++, I originally created for students to learn object-oriented C++. The reason to choose the GBA was partially (self-)motivation and partially because... well, because I can! 

We've successfully employed the engine to teach at our faculty, for over two years now. It seems to not only peak my own interest!
