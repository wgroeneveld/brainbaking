I was supposed to fly out to Norway - and then COVID came along and said "nope". Too bad, as the appealing photographs of Trondheim certainly made the [ITiCSE](http://iticse.acm.org) (_Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education_) conference even more attracting this year. Instead, it took place on-line, using Zoom and Moodle as the tools of choice. I'd like to briefly summarize things that caught my attention. I haven't been able to watch all sessions and recorded presentations, but it's an interesting exercise to dump my own thoughts here.
