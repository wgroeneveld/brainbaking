If you're interested in receiving updates on all things Brain Baking, you can simply subscribe to one of the _RSS feeds_ below. Freshly baked thoughts and ideas, served in your own favorite news reader, how about that? I like [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/), which comes with a catchy slogan:

> More news, less junk. Faster.

It's also a nice way to unify the layout of your personal news.

## The feeds

Do you want to subscribe to **everything** on this site? _(Blog, Notes)_<br/>
Use <svg class='icon icon-text'><title>feed icon</title><use xlink:href='#news'></use></svg>[/index.xml](/index.xml) or just copy-paste [brainbaking.com](brainbaking.com) in your reader to auto-discover the link.


- Are you only interested in **blog articles**? <br/>Use <svg class='icon icon-text'><title>feed icon</title><use xlink:href='#news'></use></svg>[/post/index.xml](/post/index.xml)
- Are you only interested in **notes** (the micro-blog)?<br/>Use <svg class='icon icon-text'><title>feed icon</title><use xlink:href='#news'></use></svg>[/notes/index.xml](/notes/index.xml)

If you really, _really_ want, you can also subscribe to specific categories. [See the archives](/archives) for an overview of the categories. Just add `/index.xml` to an url. For instance, to only subscribe to the _hardware_ category, use [/categories/hardware/index.xml](/categories/hardware/index.xml).
