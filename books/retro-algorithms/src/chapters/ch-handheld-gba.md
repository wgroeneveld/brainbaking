Inspecting the lifespan of the Nintendo handhelds yields a few interesting facts. In 1996, Nintendo released the Game Boy Pocket to bridge the gap between a future colorized version of the Game Boy, not to be released until two years later, and the original version. This did significantly prolong the lifespan of the Game Boy, by then already going strong for seven years. The frequent hardware revision strategy became common for all Nintendo handhelds. One year later, in 1997, Nintendo's competitor Sega would throw in the towel by discontinuing the Game Gear. 

The Game Boy Advance was only two years old when it got it's first revision, the SP - that's a lot quicker than the Game Boy Pocket. That faster cadence was maintained when looking at the Nintendo DS and 3DS. However, the total lifespan of the GBA - apart from the eccentric GB Micro - was much shorter than the GB family: the GBA came in 2001 and went in 2004 as the DS was released. 

And yet, Nintendo did not at all drop support for the GBA. Then why would a company release another handheld that poses a threat to its own product? An IGN press report from November 2003 sheds some light on this[^ign03]:

> Early Thursday morning Nintendo confirmed that it had posted a loss for the beginning half of the fiscal year, the first time ever in the company's history. It also said it would develop a new game product which would not be the successor to GameCube or Game Boy Advance for release in 2004, but no further details were specified.

The company was struggling to keep up in the console race, with Sony's PlayStation stealing N64's thunder and Microsoft entering the market with the Xbox in 2001. As the sales chart on page \pageref{sales} shows, the GameCube was doing pretty bad compared to the PS2. Nintendo initially did not intend the Nintendo DS to succeed the Game Boy Advance, although in the end, it of course did. Instead, they were looking for something in-between console and classic gaming handheld, something that would appeal to a much broader audience than just gamers. A slew of successful non-gamer friendly software titles such as _Dr. Kawashima's Brain Training_ and _Nintendogs_ did just that. 

Ultimately, the Nintendo DS family sold almost twice as much as the Game Boy Advance family. The huge success of the DS launch did not stop Nintendo from releasing another revision for the GBA, though: the tiny[^gbm] Game Boy Micro. According to the then Vice President George Harrison, the Game Boy line was Nintendo's testbed where they continuously and intentionally aspired to invent instead of merely reiterate[^inventsrc].  

[^gbm]: With dimensions of only `50`×`101`×`17.2` mm and a weight of `80` g, _tiny_ is definitely the correct word to use.

However, inventing does not necessarily mean commercial success. Indeed, according to financial reports in 2007, the Game Boy Micro was Nintendo's worst selling handheld ever, only clocking in about `2.5` million units. Then Nintendo President Satoru Iwata later admitted that the Nintendo DS may have kept the Micro from performing better sales-wise[^iwa]:

> The sales of Micro did not meet our expectations. Micro showed different sales in and outside Japan. In Japan, initial sales of Micro were rather good and it did become a rather hot topic. So, there was the possibility for this product to grow in Japan. However, toward the end of 2005, Nintendo had to focus almost all of our energies on the marketing of DS, which must have deprived the Micro of its momentum. This is why Micro couldn't meet our expectations in Japan. 

The overlapping lifespans of consoles compared to the handhelds is also worth looking at. When the Game Boy Color saw the light in 1998, the Nintendo 64 was already trying to prove itself as the SNES successor for two years. The lifespan of successive consoles and handhelds did shorten a little as the hardware engineering time decreased, eventually coinciding the lifespan of handhelds with consoles of the previous generation. 

Several NES games were ported to Game Boy Color[^portgbc], sometimes even boasting improved graphics (_Dragon Quest I/II_, _Super Mario Bros._). The GBA has jokingly be called "_a portable SNES_", and the Nintendo DS hardware made it possible to run a modified version of _Super Mario 64_ and _Diddy Kong Racing_ on it, before the 3DS brought the big guns with _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D_ and even excellent ports of GameCube games such as _Luigi's Mansion_. 

[^portgbc]: You might be inclined to think the Game Boy Color is capable of handling SNES games after playing the Donkey Kong Country on it. In reality, the game was completely remade for the GBC hardware. The term _port_ is used rather loosely.
