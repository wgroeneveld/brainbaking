### The Game Boy Pocket

In 1996, Nintendo released the Game Boy Pocket to bridge the gap between a future colorized version of the Game Boy, not to be released until two years later, and the original version. One year later, in 1997, Nintendo's main handheld competitor Sega would throw in the towel by discontinuing the Game Gear. 

Contrary to the bulky original model from '98, the Pocket only required two AAA batteries - that's a lot less weight to be carried around as a kid. The cost was `33%` less playtime, clocking in about 10 hours on average. 

The best part of the Pocket was not the weight, but the screen: `48.5 mm` width and `43.5 mm` height (`65 mm` diagonal) meant it was larger than both the original and the superseding Game Boy Color! Even if you still could not play in darker environments, the screen quality noticeably improved by reducing pixel-response time. It was far from perfect, but the "true" black-and-white screen did get rid of the four shades of green. To put a Pocket under the Christmas tree, your parents had to dish out only `$69`[^gbpprice].

[^gbpprice]: About `$113.37` in 2020. 

Under the hood, besides the screen and power supply, the technical capabilities remained unchanged.

An aluminum piece that is part of the plastic housing, not depicted here, shields the CPU chip (CPU-MGB) from signals coming from the cartridge when inserted into the black slot. \newline The clock speed is regulated by the crystal on the left of the CPU that reads 4.1943 (MHz). The smaller chip on the upper left is the LCD regulator (DMG-REG), while the one on the lower right is the amplifier (AMP-MGB). \newline Compared to the Game Boy, there's only one visible SHARP 8 KB (64K) SRAM chip. Presumably, another 8 KB was embedded in the CPU casing.}

A slightly modified version called the _Game Boy Light_ sadly only really saw 'the light' in Japan, in April 1998, only five months before the arrival of the Game Boy Color. I am sure the system would have sold overseas xjust as crazy as the other machines, since it was the first Nintendo handheld to feature an electroluminescent backlit screen. European gamers like myself had to wait until 2006 to get their hands on the GBA SP AGS-101, the second backlit Game Boy model ever created. 

The GB Light's power source were two AA batteries instead of the AAA of the pocket, good for the same twelve hours of gameplay with the backlight turned on. Visually, the BG Light and the GB Pocket look the same, except that the back of the GB Light is slightly thicker to accommodate the bigger batteries. The PCB layout is identical to the Pocket.
