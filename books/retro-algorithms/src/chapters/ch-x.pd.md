The early nineties was a golden age for gaming, and not only on handhelds. Lucky gamers with access to more powerful hardware could mess around in 3D environments, something that was deemed impossible on the Game Boy. That is, until Dylan Cuthbert of Argonaut Games decided it would be cool to create a 3D space simulator for the GB. The result is _X_, a stellar achievement released in 1992 running on one of the weakest pieces of hardware imaginable at that time.

To be fair, that's not the whole story. Argonaut Games was already well-known for their 3D space combat simulators _Starglider_ and it's successor _Starglider 2_, published in 1986 and 1988 respectively. Starglider 2 was released on Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and the ZX Spectrum. That last piece of hardware is highly interesting for us, because the Spectrum is based on a Zilog Z80 CPU running at 3.5 MHz - it has close similarities with the Game Boy's hardware, and thus, it's limitations. 

Dylan and I chat a bit about his experience creating X, and he indeed confirms that 8-bit Assembly programming on UK's beloved _Speccie_ was something he could do with his eyes closed. 

"Of course the Game Boy not a Z80 and a hybrid cut down thing but the Z80 is the closest thing to it and Iâ€™d had years of programming that on the ZX Spectrum" he recalls. 

Starglider's wireframe graphics somehow made it to the Game Boy - but how? Compared to relatively powerful machines such as the Amiga and the Atari ST, Nintendo's original handheld machine was meager and low on memory. Exactly like Sinclair's microcomputers, performance was sacrificed for affordability. 

Screenshots of different versions of Starglider 2 clarify what '_meager_' hardware means:

Reduce the palette of 15 shades to only four shades of gray and you've got something quite similar to X, including the stuttering frame rate.
