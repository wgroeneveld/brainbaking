The release of Super Mario Land 2 in 1992 fixed many shortcomings of Mario's initial transition from the NES home console to the handheld system. Bigger sprites, smoother scrolling, a world map, scarier bosses, and perhaps the most important: it was a huge financial success, guaranteeing the further continuation of the Mario franchise on the Game Boy. That sequel was playable two years later. However, it was not simply called Super Mario Land 3. That was only the subtitle. 

_Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3_ would thoroughly shake things up in the Mario universe. Instead of playing as Mario, you suddenly control Wario, Mario's evil nemesis you defeated at the end of Mario Land 2. Instead of collecting coins because... well... plumbing doesn't pay much, you're suddenly depicted as a greedy bastard that doesn't settle for mere coin: your grubby mitts nab every single piece of treasure there is to find. The atmosphere of every level changes, and so does the music. In the end, Wario still manages to steal our hearts, and the Wario Land franchise is seen as one of the very best platform games ever created.
