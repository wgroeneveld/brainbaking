## Game Cartridges

What is a game console without its games? A cafe without beer, according to Belgians. Carefully preserved game cartridges are the bread and butter of any retro game collection. As for the Game Boy family, there are four official different types of cartridges to collect: original gray Game Boy carts, black Game Boy carts that increased the color palette on the Game Boy Color, translucent Game Boy Color exclusive carts, and the smaller Game Boy Advance ones. 

Inserting Game Boy Color games into an older Game Boy system is not impossible, but the notch on the top right of the cartridge prevents the power switch from sliding all the way to the left. Due to changes in aesthetics, owners of the Pocket could boot up these games, only to be greeted with a screen that states your Game Boy is incompatible with the games. 

Provided the game did boot in the first place. Remember air-blowing into the cartridge to clear out any dust, because the boot-up sequence got stuck at a badly scrambled Nintendo logo? These cartridge slots were not spring-loaded: there was no Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) connection smoothly accepting the cartridge that should avoid angry gamers from jamming the game in the handheld and potentially damaging things. Eventually, Nintendo did migrate towards a ZIF slot with the later Nintendo DS and Switch consoles.

Blowing the cartridge might never have fixed anything. Instead, simply removing the cartridge and reinserting would have been enough for the connectors to correctly touch each other. In fact, according to Nintendo's NES Game Pak Troubleshooting webpage, overenthusiastic blowers might even damage the cart[^nesfaq]:

> 4. Do not blow into your Game Paks or systems. The moisture in your breath can corrode and contaminate the pin connectors.

The lesson here is to not spit on sensitive electronic contacts. Still, _Blow The Cartridge_ became a popular meme, and even a retro video game comic. With the release of the Switch, Nintendo engineers came up with a clever solution to make sure game carts never came in contact with our mouth:

> To avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion, keep the game card away from young children. A bittering agent (Denatonium Benzoate) has also been applied to the game card. This bittering agent is non-toxic.

Of course, the very first thing game reporters did was licking Switch cartridges to "verify these claims". Yuck.

As the fifth generation consoles advanced its technologies, with Sony's PlayStation on the front line, the rise of cheap mass-producible optical discs superseded the more expensive circuit boards with custom chips. Except that Nintendo's N64 reluctantly clung onto the cartridge system. CDs indeed increased storage capacity, making way for bigger texture maps and more intricate level design, but we tend to forget the biggest downside: loading times.

When comparing the Nintendo DS to the Sony PSP, this disadvantage is especially painful. A Gamespot article, bluntly subtitled "_Let's face it. The PSP suffers from horrendous load times. But just how bad are they?_", concludes that "_PSP games take a long time to load. Hardly any PSP games took less than a minute to load and quite a few took two or more._"[^gspsp] The solution? Jailbraking your PSP and ripping games onto a Memory Stick, a horrendous proprietary flash memory card system. I'm sure it must have been a source of great jokes at Nintendo staff parties.

Memory-mapped IO is responsible for the near-instant load times, allowing developers to treat cartridge ROM and RAM as if they were soldered on the game device itself. Other advantages of cartridges include the freedom to install anything you could think of on the PCB and less system RAM usage that is typically required to read CD-ROMs. While "blowing the cart" might fix a N64 cart, a damaged PS1 CD-ROM can only be tossed in the bin. Popular early home computers such as the Atari 400 and the Commodore 64 also made use of cartridges, next to magnetic media.
