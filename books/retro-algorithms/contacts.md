"bruikbaar" genoeg? Wario interview: https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0108/soft02/interv/page02.html 

> That kind of play was also realized because the advance made more memory available.
Hosokawa: Even with various elements, I made it in the form of cutting away from the parts that would not be needed unless it was finally included.
> Matsuoka If you collect CDs in the pyramid, you can listen to them. The sound room is playful, and some of the staff's Wario cosplay photos are included. As a creator, I wanted to show you that you can play this kind of game with Advance.
N.O.M
The sound data is also large.
Matsuoka: The sound is loud.
Abe: A large part of the capacity is songs.
> Smooth animation is also an advanced ability.
Matsuoka: Because the processing capacity is completely different, the movement is completely different from GB.
Interview Abe: The amount you draw is different. You can stick and draw.
Hosokawa: It has rotation and enlargement functions, so by using it, you can make it look like there are many even a few drawings. It's a little three-dimensional movement.
> So that's it. It's definitely muscle muscular (laughs). Were there any unique aspects of the course design?
Hosokawa: Up until now, I could only have one background picture on Game Boy. By stacking it with 2 or 3 sheets, you can create a hidden course or a path that you can see when you enter it, even though you can't see it. After that, it is now possible to produce effective effects by overlaying such graphics such as trees and rain. This time, the course itself is set so that everyone can enjoy it, as I said, so there is always a way to go to the end. After that, I made it so that the difficulty level gradually increases so that even people who like action can fully enjoy it.
> Are there any points you devised in the program?
Interview Abe: This is the first time for me to do this, but in terms of the surroundings, it was a lot easier to develop from Advance. Now that I can use C, I can program much faster than before. I was in charge of the mini game and the CD part.
